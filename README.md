# Unveiling the Invasion: Advancing Ecological Mapping of Heterotheca subaxillaris through Integrated Remote Sensing Techniques with Drones and Satellites

This repository contains the data and code for the research paper titled "Unveiling the Invasion: Advancing Ecological Mapping of Heterotheca subaxillaris through Integrated Remote Sensing Techniques with Drones and Satellites," published in the IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observation and Remote Sensing (JSTARS).

## Abstract

The invasion of non-native plant species poses a significant threat to global biodiversity and ecosystem stability. This research focuses on the invasive species *Heterotheca subaxillaris* (camphorweed), a major concern in the coastal sand dunes of the eastern Mediterranean. The study showcases an innovative approach that integrates multi-sensor remote sensing data from drones and satellites to map and monitor the spread of this invasive species. By combining the high spatial resolution of drone imagery with the broad coverage of satellite data (Vision-1, PlanetScope, and Sentinel-2), we developed a robust and scalable methodology for early detection and accurate mapping of *H. subaxillaris*. The findings of this research provide valuable insights for conservationists and land managers, offering a cost-effective and efficient tool for managing invasive species and preserving native ecosystems.

## Data

This repository is organized into four main folders, each containing data from a different remote sensing platform:

### 1. Drone Data

This folder contains high-resolution aerial imagery and derived products (e.g., orthomosaics, digital surface models) acquired using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) or drone. The drone data provides fine-grained spatial details, enabling the precise identification and delineation of *H. subaxillaris* patches.

### 2. Vision-1 Satellite Data

This folder contains data from the Vision-1 satellite, a high-resolution commercial Earth observation satellite. The Vision-1 data offers a balance between spatial resolution and coverage, making it suitable for regional-scale mapping of the invasive species.

### 3. PlanetScope Satellite Data

This folder contains data from the PlanetScope satellite constellation, which provides daily, high-resolution imagery of the Earth's surface. The high temporal frequency of PlanetScope data is crucial for monitoring the phenological changes of *H. subaxillaris* and tracking its expansion over time.

### 4. Sentinel-2 Satellite Data

This folder contains data from the Sentinel-2 mission, part of the European Union's Copernicus Programme. Sentinel-2 provides multispectral imagery with a wide swath and a 5-day revisit time, making it ideal for large-scale, long-term monitoring of vegetation dynamics and the impact of the invasion.
